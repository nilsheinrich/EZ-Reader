#Bayesian parameter inference for the EZ-Reader

This repository contains all modules of the EZ-Reader model of eye-movement control in reading by Reichle et al. (1998, 1999).

A exemplary output of a conducted parameter inference can also be found. Among other things the ouput consists of the SynthL (synthetic likelihood) .dat files containing the values for the infered parameters for each individual chain, an error.log, an  output.log, and the plots generated by get_plots.py on the basis of the simulated data. 

For a thorough documentation of the code, please read the Lab_Report.pdf
