# EZ-Reader
Bayesian parameter inference for EZ-Reader by Reichle (in Python)

This repository contains all modules of the EZ-Reader model of eye-movement control in reading by Reichle et al. (1998, 1999).
The actual code for the EZ-Reader model can be found within the "EZReader" folder.

An exemplary output of a conducted parameter inference can also be found. Among other things the output consists of the SynthL (synthetic likelihood) .dat files containing the values for the infered parameters for each individual chain, an error.log, an  output.log, and the plots generated by get_plots.py on the basis of the simulated data. 

For a thorough documentation of the code, please read the Lab_Report.pdf

# Short tutorial on how to run a simulation with the model
1) After having successfully cloned the repository on your local machine, navigate to the respective folder in your shell of choice
2) run ./make_env.sh  - it will set up the virtual environment
3) run env_from__make_env/bin/activate within your shell  - this will source the virtual environment (a necessary step), now you are ready to go
4) run the python script save_single_run  - it will use the default values for the free parameters as well as the default corpus to simulate a single reading of this corpus of sentences

the resulting tmp.txt file will hold the fixation data of the simulated run
