Note that this version of the DREAM-ZS algorithm comes with an additional setting "stochstic_loglike", which, when set to TRUE, re-evaluates the likelihood for the previous position of the chain for every step, irrespective of whether a new position is accepted or rejected. This was introduced to overcome the problem of "stuck chain". The problem arises, when the likelihood can only be calculated with limited accuracy, i.e., it contains stochasticity.
